# BreweryDBExtract
Extract, Transform, and Load for BreweryDB Data
This is a means of getting breweries, beers, and hop data from The Brewery DB.
This makes use of Python's robust PyODBC package
Obtain a key from http://www.brewerydb.com/ in order to get this to function.

Please let me know if you'd like to contribute more to this. The goal here is to make a simpler way to extract this data using Python. Prior examples of similar scripts were focused on small subsets of data--the goal here is to get larger volumes of data extracted to a database for more extensive analysis.
